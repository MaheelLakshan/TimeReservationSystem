Reservation System for Interdisciplinary Studies Department
Undergraduate Software Project for the 3rd Year
Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna

Description:
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a Reservation System developed as an Undergraduate Software Project for the 3rd year at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Ruhuna. The system is specifically designed for the Interdisciplinary Studies Department to streamline the reservation process and efficiently manage resources.

Features:

1. Reservation Management: The system provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting reservations for various resources within the Interdisciplinary Studies Department. Users can specify the date, time, and duration of the reservation, as well as any additional requirements or special instructions.

2. Resource Tracking: The system allows administrators to maintain a comprehensive inventory of resources available for reservation. Users can view the availability and details of each resource before making a reservation.

3. User Authentication and Access Control: The system employs a secure authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can create and manage reservations. Different user roles and permissions are implemented to control access to specific functionalities within the system.

4. Notifications: The system incorporates email or SMS notifications to keep users informed about reservation updates, reminders, and any changes to their reservations. This helps to minimize conflicts and improve communication between users and administrators.

5. Reporting and Analytics: The system generates reports and analytics to provide valuable insights into reservation patterns, resource utilization, and other relevant metrics. This information can assist in decision-making and optimizing the allocation of resources.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
